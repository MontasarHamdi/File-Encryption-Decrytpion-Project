Obi-Wan Kenobi:
Hello there.

General Grievous:
General Kenobi. You are a bold one. Kill him!

General Grievous:
Back away! I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.

Obi-Wan Kenobi:
Your move.

General Grievous:
You fool. I've been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

[Grievous' two arms split into four. Each activates and wields a stolen lightsaber.]

General Grievous:
Attack, Kenobi!
